## 1. Introduction
WikiWalks is a community-driven bushwalking/hiking application, that records and combines its usersâ€™ location data to create a clear and easy to understand map, of walking tracks available in a local area. These maps will be available offline for users of the WikiWalks app to download and will provide users with directions. The more a path is used by people the more precise the path will become on the wiki walks application.

| The problem of | Though there are many maps available that highlight bushwalking tracks in an area, they are often physical and unable to show real-time user location leading them to be slow and hard to use. The few bushwalking applications that are available, are often missing tracks or show outdated walking paths, and some may even require cell phone reception meaning that the areas where they are useful are limited. |
| Affects | Bushwalkers, Emergency services, Environmental Researchers |
| The impact of which is | Users are likely to get lost, or take non-optimal paths to get to a location |
| A successful solution would be | an application that shows tracks that are available for the users to follow and gives directions on how to get to different locations |
