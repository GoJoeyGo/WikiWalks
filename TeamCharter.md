<h1 align="center"><u>Team Charter</u></h1>


**Team Name:** WikiWalks Project  
**Team Mission and Objectives or Goals**  
The team has been formed to work on the WikiWalks project, an Android app to crowdsource bush paths and display paths in the user's area. The goal of the team is to successfully plan and then create the app and its backend with all basic capabilities and ideally some bonus nicety features.

**Some specific goals include:**
* a backend that can:
  * [ ] accept path submissions from the app
  * [ ] use a database to store paths
  * [ ] combine paths over time to create a more accurate path
* an app that can:
  * [ ] allow users to record a path using location data
  * [ ] allow users to report a path
  * [ ] cache maps offline
  * [ ] record path history
  * [ ] allow saving paths for later
  * [ ] track walking statistics
 * [ ] proper project planning for efficient work

Potential hindrances:
* members may be constrained for time by other commitments
* there may be poor or conflicting understanding of a goal
* the team may get caught for too long on one section

2. Assignments
    1. The team leader shall assign work to each member for each iteration
    2. If a member has any concerns about their work, they should bring it up immediately
    3. Members should notify the team well in advance if they believe they will not make a deadline
    4. Work should be of high quality and meet set standards
3. Attitude
    1. Members should act politely to each other
    2. Members should act professionally
    3. Members should be cooperative and open to ideas regarding the project, even if they initially disagree
4. Contact
    1. Members should primarily use Discord to communicate
    2. If a member is unreachable on Discord, the leader should email them
    3. Members should respond within a timely manner, ideally 24h max unless prior notice is given
5. Remediation procedures
    1. Members should try to adapt to resolve the problem as quickly as possible
    2. If the problem is major, an emergency meeting should be held
6. Decision making
    1. The team should hold a vote with majority votes winning
    2. If the vote ends in a tie, compromises should be made
    3. If compromising is impossible, the team leader should make the decision

Members who fail to abide by these rules will be given a strike, and after 3 strikes serious consideration will be made by the rest of the team whether the subject coordinator should be approached regarding keeping the member on the team.

4. Have the team leader make a final decision
5. If members still refuse to cooperate, issue them a strike
