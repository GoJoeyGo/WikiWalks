Changelog:

Bullet point refix code:
- Tyler
* Joey
~ Sanjay

Architecture:
- Fixed grammar
- Reworded goals and philosophies as it did not clearly explain 
- Removed reference to waterfall as that's not what we're using
- Made architectural goal reasoning more clear as it was worded confusingly
- Changed phone in assumptions to device, as it will also work on tablets
- Added adding paths to the database to significant requirements
- Improved wording of rejecting bad path data

- Clarified that the database will be SQLite
- Clarified GitHub usage as it was too vague
- Reworded low power decision as it was worded confusingly
- Changed "navigate to" feature to just selecting different pre-recorded routes as a proper "navigate to" feature may take too long to implement properly
- Changed references to the database storing PathMaps to just paths as PathMap will instead be a local class for storing paths on the app
- Completely reworded backups section as it was not accurate
- Changed why removing paths will be implemented
- Reworded security reasoning as it wasn't written clearly

- Added basic user acceptance tests to iteration table
- Changed server dependency to be more specific
