# The WikiWalks Project
The WikiWalks project will be an Android app that allows users to browse bush paths in their area, as well as record their own paths and submit them to the database. This will require developing a backend and a frontend. The backend will use a Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python stack, and the frontend will be developed in Java using Android Studio.
## Key features
Priority features to get the software to a functional state.
## Backend
- Storing paths in a database
- Receiving paths from the app and verifying their validity
- Receiving more information on an existing path to make a more accurate path
- Sending path information for specific map areas
- Being able to handle multiple path requests at once
## Frontend
- Use of the Google Maps API to display a map
- Pulling paths from the backend and overlaying them on the map
- Allow users to send their location data and altitude to map a new path
- Allow users to mark points of interest along a path (e.g. rest spots)
- Allow users to report paths for being inaccurate, risky, etc.
- Simplistic UI design that's easy and efficient to use
- Caching of paths in a user's area
- Showing the quickest path between points
- Showing branching paths
- Allow saving of paths for later
- Tracking user walking statistics and past paths
## Additional features
These will be added if there is time left.
- Import and export of saved data
- Option to request a random path in the area
- Distance goals
